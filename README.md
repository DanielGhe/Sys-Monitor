# Sys-Monitor
App that monitor your CPU usage

This app was a team project and I was the leader of the team. We made a simple app that monitors the CPU usage and send a notification when the user's set load percentage is passed over. The app was made using JavaScript, Node.js, and Electron for porting the app to desktop.
